The idea of this directory is to collect Waterloo created
programs here so that when moving to new versions of OS161
we have them all in one place and we know what we need
to move/port. It structure and functionality is
similar to the testbin except to simply the
Makefile in each directory they all include uw-prog.mk
from this directory.

I'm starting by trying to add a few of the programs that
get used by some of the automated testing scripts.

syscall  - example program: how a syscall works used in the course notes
segments - example program: how different segments used in the course notes
argtest  - is a useful program that I ask people to use when 
           when trying to implement argc/argv.

vm-*     - are a bunch of different test programs I wrote
           to try to test the VM subsystem for assignment 3.
